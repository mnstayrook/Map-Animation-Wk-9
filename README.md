# Title: Bus Tracker

_Created by Maegan Stayrook_

Description:
An assignment from the MERN Full Stack Development course was taken and nodified for this project. Modifications include updating the map style to look more customized, speeding up the counter, and zooming out a little so a viewer can see the whole image without having to move or zoom.

How to Run:
Click the button labeled "Show stops between MIT and Harvard."

Roadmap:
Some things are being considered at this time.
- Creating a reset button so a viewer does not have to refresh the page to make it run the path again.
- Creating a loop so the bus runs back and forth.
- Including more bus stops on the path.
- Changing the button style so it is more like a list than a giant button at the top of the page.
